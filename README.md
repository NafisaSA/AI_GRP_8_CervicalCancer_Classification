Description of the problem and dataset:

The Multi-Cancer dataset from Kaggle is designed for medical image classification and contains histopathological images spanning 8 main cancer types and 26 subclasses. In this project, the focus is on classifying cervical cancer from the dataset. The problem is challenging due to the multi-class nature of the data, potential class imbalance, and variations in image quality. Accurate classification is highly important since early detection of cervical cancer can significantly improve patient outcomes. This dataset provides a strong foundation for applying deep learning and transfer learning approaches, such as CNNs, to develop reliable models for medical diagnosis.
